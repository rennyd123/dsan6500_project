Chest X-rays (CXRs) are one of the most powerful tools a doctor has. They are a reliable method of observing the structures and organs in a patientâ€™s chest, as well as faster and cheaper than other imaging methods, such as a Computer Tomography (CT) scan, which makes them the most popular method of chest imaging available. CXRs can identify infections, cancer, lung conditions, heart-related issues, lung problems, and more. Heart and lung illnesses can often be severe or lead to severe health problems, so quickly identifying and diagnosing potential illnesses is integral to a positive health outcome. 

Despite their popularity, CXRs can be difficult and time consuming to read, even more so than scans such as chest CTs, which provide more detail (Satia, I., 2013, 349). With CXRs being such a popular test, radiologists can easily be overwhelmed by having to read such a large quantity of images, causing patients to get results at a slower pace, putting them at further risk while they wait for a diagnosis. Forcing radiologists to read scans faster, however, may result in inaccurate diagnoses. Therefore, this dilemma of how to make the scan reading process more efficient while still providing accurate results is a valuable area for research and convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) may just be the answer.
